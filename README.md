Hi!

This is just my journey of learning coding. I do not know how to use Git properly either. So I will be learning that in parallel.

But this contains my code for learning ruby from scratch. Including the "Hello World" file. :D

There will be other repositories which will consist of other things like tutorials I followed, mini-projects, etc.

I am learning ruby from a youtuber called Mike Dane. You can find him with a simple search.

He is awesome! Do check out if you want to learn to code! :D

Thanks, Shashaank
